== Postdeployment steps

=== Test the deployment

As shown in <<2-stacks-created>>, your deployment has created two AWS CloudFormation stacks: an Elastic Beanstalk stack with a randomly generated name and a CodePipeline stack that was named when you deployed the Quick Start. (The name of the CodePipeline stack also appears under the *Outputs* tab, as shown in <<cfn_outputs>>).

Test the deployment as follows:

. Open the CodePipeline console, and view your https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codepipeline/pipelines[created pipelines^]. Verify that the status of the pipeline created in this deployment is *Succeeded*, as shown in <<pipeline-succeeded>>.

. Navigate to the *Outputs* tab for the Elastic Beanstalk CloudFormation stack, as shown in <<load-balancer-url>>. Choose the load-balancer URL, and verify that the webpage loads.

. Navigate to the Elastic Beanstalk environment created by AWS CloudFormation, choose the URL for the application, and confirm that your sample application is deployed from GitHub.
. Modify the sample application code of your forked GitHub repository, and check in the changes. 
. Verify that CodePipeline starts the CI/CD process and deploys your latest code changes to Elastic Beanstalk.
